                My biggest dream is to be my own boss. To work for myself and only do the work I want to do, that seems fun! To set my own schedule and work when I want or need to. To sit in the sun and create content, to get up at 6am and get work done when my family is asleep. And to earn enough money so that we can live comfortably and feel secure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
              <p class="body-text"> <span class="header">Reality</span>
              The reality right now is that I have one freelance client, one day a week. That is it. I have ideas about what I want to do, but I have no followers, to clients, no customers and no idea how to actually sell anything that I don't really know yet. I am only in the beginning of this project Girlboss and I am not sure of where to go.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
              <p class="body-text"> <span class="header">Steps</span>
              So how do I take reality and turn it into my dream? How do I go from unsure, unknown and scared to strong, secure and happy? First of all I start by getting all the knowledge I need, and by knowing it! Second I show people, myself as well!, that "hey! I know these things!" And finally, I start telling people that "I can help you". </p>
